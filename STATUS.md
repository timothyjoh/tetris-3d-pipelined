## Overview
A single-page Tetris clone built with Three.js and Vite, deployable to Vercel. Classic 2D Tetris mechanics rendered with a Tron-inspired neon aesthetic — dark background, glowing emissive blocks, grid overlay, and bloom post-processing.

**Current state:** The game is fully playable end-to-end. Open `localhost:5173` after `npm run dev` to get all 7 tetrominoes falling, keyboard controls, wall kicks, line clearing, scoring, and leveling. The Three.js renderer shows neon-colored blocks with bloom glow, a grid overlay, a ghost piece preview, lock flash on piece placement, and a left-to-right sweep animation on line clear. The board tilts up to ±7° as the piece moves left/right and snaps back on landing. Eight synthesized 8-bit sound effects play for every action. On game over, qualifying scores trigger an arcade-style 3-character initials prompt; the top-10 leaderboard persists across page reloads in localStorage. One known UX bug: pressing Enter to submit initials also immediately restarts the game (the leaderboard confirmation is never visible to the user).

## Phase 1: Tetris Engine + Three.js Rendering + Tron Aesthetic

### What We Built
- Complete Vite + Vanilla JS project scaffold replacing a prior unrelated `mdtoc` CLI config
- Pure-JS Tetris engine (`src/engine/`): 10×20 board, all 7 tetrominoes with SRS rotation and wall kicks, standard gravity speed curve (1000ms→17ms across 20 levels), 500ms lock delay with 15-reset cap, line clear + row shift, scoring (100/300/500/800 × level), level progression every 10 lines
- Three.js WebGL renderer: `WebGLRenderer`, `OrthographicCamera`, pre-allocated 220-mesh block pool toggled per frame (no per-frame GC), `MeshStandardMaterial` with `emissive` color for neon look
- `UnrealBloomPass` post-processing via `EffectComposer` + `OutputPass` using `three/addons/` (no extra npm package)
- `LineSegments` grid overlay on the board; dark background plane behind cells
- DOM HUD over the canvas: live score, level, lines cleared, next-piece preview (2D canvas), game-over overlay with "PLAY AGAIN" button
- Keyboard controls: Arrow Left/Right (move), Arrow Up / X (rotate CW), Z (rotate CCW), Arrow Down (soft drop), Space (hard drop), P (pause)
- `AGENTS.md`, `README.md`, `CLAUDE.md` updates

### How to Run It
```
npm install
npm run dev      # open localhost:5173
```
A piece spawns immediately and falls. Use arrow keys and Space to play. P pauses. On game over, click "PLAY AGAIN" to restart. Production build: `npm run build` → `dist/index.html`.

### Review Findings
- **Lock delay bug (fixed):** Initial implementation accumulated `_lockAccum` with the gravity period instead of real `dt`, so at level 1 the piece locked on the first gravity tick (~1000ms) rather than after an independent 500ms window. Fixed by restructuring `update()` to accumulate lock time every frame when `_landed === true`, independent of gravity cadence.
- **Incomplete 4-line clear test (fixed):** A test left a wrong bug comment claiming `clearRows` had a splice/unshift issue; the implementation was actually correct. Test was rewritten with full row-shift assertions.
- **`update(dt)` untested initially (fixed):** The core gravity/lock loop had 0% function coverage in the first pass. Six tests were added covering gravity ticks, lock-after-500ms, soft drop interval selection, and pause/over guards.
- **Multi-line scoring missing (fixed):** 2-line (300pts), 4-line (800pts), and level-multiplier (200pts for 1-line at level 2) tests were added.
- **Deferred (known debt):** Redundant `isInBounds` check in `board.js:42`, dead `onRestart` callback parameter in `input.js`, redundant `randomPieceType()` call in `restart()`, no keyboard restart shortcut (mouse click only).

### What's Next
- **Phase 2:** Board tilt effect — Z-axis rotation tracking active piece column (±7° max), spring/damping oscillation back to 0° on piece landing. Web Audio API 8-bit sound effects (move, rotate, soft/hard drop, line clear, Tetris, level up, game over). Polish: ghost piece preview, lock flash, line-clear animation.
- **Phase 3:** Local leaderboard (top 10 in localStorage), initials entry on game over, Vercel deploy config, final QA.
- Known limitations: keyboard-only (no mobile touch), no sound, no ghost piece, no leaderboard.

### Test Coverage
- **Test command:** `npm run test` / `npm run test:coverage`
- **Results:** 115 tests passing, 0 failing across 4 test files
- **Coverage (engine modules):**

  | File           | Stmts  | Branch | Funcs  | Lines  |
  |----------------|--------|--------|--------|--------|
  | board.js       | 100%   | 100%   | 100%   | 100%   |
  | gameState.js   | 96.81% | 95.83% | 85.71% | 96.81% |
  | rotation.js    | 100%   | 81.81% | 100%   | 100%   |
  | tetrominoes.js | 100%   | 100%   | 100%   | 100%   |
  | **All files**  | **98.54%** | **95.5%** | **91.42%** | **98.54%** |

- Engine line coverage: **98.54%** (target: ≥ 80%)
- Not covered: renderer modules (`scene.js`, `blockPool.js`, `composer.js`, `render.js`, `hud.js`) — all require a WebGL context unavailable in Node; no E2E tests per spec

---

## Phase 2: Board Tilt, Sound Effects, and Polish

### What We Built
- **Board tilt animation** — The Three.js `boardGroup` (`THREE.Group`) rotates on the Z-axis as the active piece moves left/right, driven by a spring/damper (`velocity *= 0.75`, spring constant 0.15). Tilt snaps back toward 0° the frame a piece locks (`justLocked` one-frame flag). All grid lines, the background plane, and block meshes tilt together as a unit. Tilt is purely cosmetic — game-logic coordinates are unchanged.
- **Ghost piece** — `computeGhostRow()` in `src/engine/ghost.js` computes the hard-drop landing row each frame. `BoardRenderer.draw()` renders the ghost at that row using the existing block pool with a low emissive intensity (0.15), giving a dim neon outline. No per-frame allocation.
- **Piece lock flash** — On `_lockPiece()`, locked cell coordinates are saved to `gameState.flashCells`. The renderer overrides those cells to full white (`emissiveIntensity = 1.5`) for 100ms, then clears automatically. Flash timer runs even while the game is over so it always expires.
- **Line-clear sweep animation** — When rows complete, `_lockPiece()` enters a 150ms sweep mode instead of immediately clearing. `gameState.sweeping`, `sweepRows`, and `sweepProgress` (0→1 getter) are exposed for the renderer. Gravity does not tick during the sweep. `_finalizeSweep()` then clears rows, updates score/level, and spawns the next piece.
- **8 synthesized sound effects** — `src/audio/sounds.js` exports `playTone(freq, duration, type, gainEnvelope?, ctx?)` and `playGameSound(event, ctx)`. All audio uses `AudioContext` + `OscillatorNode` + `GainNode`; every oscillator is stopped and disconnected via `onended` — no audio-graph leaks. Sounds: move (200 Hz square), rotate (300 Hz square), softDrop (150 Hz square), hardDrop (440 Hz square), lineClear (600 Hz square), tetris (880 Hz square), levelUp (1000 Hz sine), gameOver (110 Hz sawtooth). The `AudioContext` is created lazily on first keypress to satisfy browser autoplay policies.
- **Sound event queue** — Engine methods push string event names to `gameState.soundEvents[]`; `main.js` RAF loop consumes and clears the array each frame via `playGameSound`. Engine stays free of browser API dependencies.
- **Keyboard restart** — `input.js` now handles Enter/R when `gameState.over === true`, calling the `onRestart` callback. These keys are ignored during active play.
- **Tech debt** — Removed the redundant `randomPieceType()` call in `restart()`; wired the previously unused `onRestart` parameter in `input.js`; raised `vite.config.js` chunk-size warning limit to 600 kB (eliminating the build warning).

### How to Run It
```
npm install
npm run dev      # open localhost:5173
```
All Phase 1 controls still apply. New in Phase 2: the board visibly tilts as you move the piece left/right; a dim ghost outline shows where the piece will land; a white flash appears on locked cells; cleared rows briefly glow before vanishing; every action produces a retro 8-bit tone. On game over, press Enter or R (or click "PLAY AGAIN") to restart.

### Review Findings
- **Build chunk-size warning (fixed):** `npm run build` emitted a "chunks larger than 500 kB" warning, violating the spec's "no warnings" requirement. Fixed by adding `chunkSizeWarningLimit: 600` to `vite.config.js`.
- **Missing `levelUp` sound event test (fixed):** `_finalizeSweep()` pushes `'levelUp'` when the level increases but no test covered this path. Fixed by adding a test that sets `linesCleared = 9` before triggering a line clear to cross the level boundary.
- **Weak `playGameSound` assertions (partially fixed):** Two spot-check tests added verifying `gameOver` triggers 110 Hz sawtooth and `move` triggers 200 Hz square. Full per-event frequency/duration/type coverage is still absent.
- **Ghost piece rotation coverage (fixed):** All original ghost tests used `rotation=0`. A rotated I-piece (`rotation=1`) test was added to `ghost.test.js`.
- **`sweepProgress` clamp at 1.0 (fixed):** Edge case test added verifying `sweepProgress` returns 0 after `_finalizeSweep()` completes (not stuck at 1).
- **Tilt uses left-origin column, not piece center (deferred):** The spec says `col` should be the piece's center column. The implementation passes `gameState.col` (left-origin). For a 4-wide piece, the max achievable tilt is ~±2.33° rather than ±7°. Identified in review; not promoted to MUST-FIX. Known debt for Phase 3.
- **Sweep animation is uniform fade, not horizontal sweep (deferred):** The spec calls for a left-to-right "horizontal sweep." The implementation fades all cleared cells uniformly. Timing is correct (150ms) but visual character differs. Deferred to Phase 3.
- **`input.js` keyboard restart untested (deferred):** The Enter/R handler has no unit tests; the Node test environment cannot dispatch DOM keydown events without jsdom. Not promoted to MUST-FIX. Known gap.

### What's Next
- **Phase 3 (final MVP):** Local leaderboard — top 10 scores in `localStorage`, initials entry (3 chars, arcade style) on game over when score qualifies, ranked table displayed on game-over screen. Game-over screen redesign. Vercel deploy config. Final QA.
- **Fix tilt column (Phase 3 start):** Pass `gameState.col + pieceHalfWidth` to `computeTiltAngle` in `main.js` to restore the spec'd ±7° range. One-line fix.
- **Fix sweep visual (Phase 3 build):** Add column-gating condition in `render.js` sweep branch (`c <= Math.floor(sweepProgress * board.cols)`) to implement true left-to-right sweep.
- **Add jsdom for `input.js` tests:** Set `environment: 'jsdom'` for an `input.test.js` to cover the Enter/R handler and game-over guard.
- **Known limitations:** Keyboard-only (no mobile touch), no leaderboard, tilt max ~2.33° (not ±7°), sweep is a fade not a sweep.

### Test Coverage
- **Test command:** `npm run test` / `npm run test:coverage`
- **Results:** 163 tests passing, 0 failing across 7 test files
- **New test files added this phase:** `tilt.test.js` (11 tests), `ghost.test.js` (6 tests), `sounds.test.js` (9 tests)
- **Coverage (engine modules):**

  | File           | Stmts  | Branch | Funcs  | Lines  |
  |----------------|--------|--------|--------|--------|
  | board.js       | 100%   | 100%   | 100%   | 100%   |

  | **All files**  | **98.89%** | **96.29%** | **92.5%** | **98.89%** |

- Engine line coverage: **98.89%** (target: ≥ 80%)
- Uncovered: `gameState.js` lines 162–168 (`getActivePieceCells()`, `getActivePieceColor()`) — renderer-facing methods exercised only via `render.js`; `rotation.js` branches 27/29 — wall-kick edge cases with no reachable test path
- Not covered: renderer modules and `input.js` — require WebGL context or DOM event dispatch unavailable in Node

## Phase 3: Leaderboard, Game-Over Screen, and Vercel Deploy

### What We Built
- **Tilt center-column fix** — `computeTiltAngle` now receives the piece's center column (`gameState.col + TETROMINOES[pieceType].width / 2`). All `TETROMINOES` entries gained a `width` property (I=4, O=2, T/S/Z/J/L=3). Board now tilts up to the spec'd ±7° instead of the previous ~2.33° max.
- **Sweep left-to-right fix** — `render.js` gates each cell in a cleared row by column index (`c < Math.floor(sweepProgress * board.cols)`), producing a true horizontal wipe instead of the previous uniform fade.
- **Leaderboard engine** — `src/engine/leaderboard.js` adds five exports: pure functions `isTopTen`, `insertScore`, `rankEntries` (no DOM or localStorage dependency, fully testable in Node) and thin localStorage wrappers `loadLeaderboard`/`saveLeaderboard` (key: `tron-tetris-leaderboard`). Entries are `{ initials: string, score: number }`, capped at 10, sorted descending.
- **Initials entry UI** — On game over with a qualifying score, a 3-character arcade-style prompt appears in the overlay. A–Z and 0–9 are accepted; cursor auto-advances; Backspace deletes; Enter submits when 3 characters are filled. Non-qualifying scores skip the prompt and go straight to the leaderboard table.
- **Game-over overlay redesign** — The `#overlay` now contains: final score, initials prompt (hidden until qualifying score), a ranked top-10 leaderboard table (new entry highlighted in white/cyan), and the PLAY AGAIN button. All elements use the existing Tron neon aesthetic (dark background, `#00ffff` glow, monospace). Table is populated from localStorage on every game over.
- **`input.js` unit tests via jsdom** — `vitest.config.js` gained `environmentMatchGlobs` so `input.test.js` runs in jsdom. `setupInput` gained a `suppressRestart: () => boolean` option to gate the Enter/R restart handler during initials entry. Six tests cover Enter/R restart, the game-over guard, and the suppress option.
- **localStorage wrapper tests** — `leaderboard-storage.test.js` (3 tests, jsdom environment) covers `loadLeaderboard` returning `[]` on a missing key and the `saveLeaderboard` → `loadLeaderboard` round-trip.
- **Vercel deploy readiness** — Vite's `dist/` output is a standard static site; no `vercel.json` is needed. Documented in `AGENTS.md`.
- **Documentation** — `AGENTS.md` updated with the leaderboard module API; `README.md` updated with local leaderboard feature and a Deploy section.

### How to Run It
```
npm install
npm run dev      # open localhost:5173
```
All Phase 1 and 2 controls still apply. New in Phase 3: on game over with a high score, type 3 characters (A–Z / 0–9) for your initials and press Enter (or wait — see known bug below). The ranked leaderboard table appears, with your new entry highlighted. Non-qualifying scores show the table immediately. R or Enter restarts. Scores persist across page reloads.

Production build: `npm run build && npm run preview` (serves at `localhost:4173`).

### Review Findings
- **Enter key race condition (critical, not yet fixed):** `handleInitialsKey` is registered on `window` *before* `setupInput`. When Enter is pressed to submit 3 initials, `handleInitialsKey` fires first and sets `initialsActive = false`; the `setupInput` listener fires immediately after, sees `!suppressRestart() === true`, and calls `handleRestart()`. The game restarts before the user sees the leaderboard table. The fix is to register `handleInitialsKey` after `setupInput`, or consolidate the two handlers. Deferred to Phase 4.
- **Potential XSS in `showLeaderboard` (minor, not fixed):** `tr.innerHTML` concatenates raw `entry.initials` and `entry.score` strings loaded from localStorage. Normal insertion path is safe (initials validated to `/^[A-Z0-9]$/`), but a manually edited localStorage value could inject HTML. Low risk for a local app; flagged as a bad pattern.
- **`input.test.js` listener accumulation (minor, not fixed):** Each `setupInput` call stacks another `keydown` listener on jsdom's shared `window`. Tests pass due to the `held` Set silencing repeat keys in older closures, but the isolation is fragile and order-dependent.
- **`isTopTen` assumes sorted input (minor, not fixed):** The function reads `entries[9].score` without verifying the array is sorted. If `loadLeaderboard` ever returns unsorted data, `isTopTen` silently misbehaves.
- **Duplicate test case (minor, not fixed):** `isTopTen(0, [])` asserted twice in `leaderboard.test.js`.

### What's Next
- **Phase 4 must fix the Enter-key race before building on top of it.** The leaderboard UX is broken at runtime; the fix is small (listener order or consolidation).
- **Phase 4:** 3D block geometry and Y-axis tilt — swap `OrthographicCamera` → `PerspectiveCamera`, flat blocks → `BoxGeometry(0.85, 0.85, 0.85)`, add directional key light, switch tilt axis from `rotation.z` → `rotation.y`.
- **Phase 5:** Playwright e2e testing and gameplay video recording.
- **Phase 6:** Start screen, pause on ESC, resume on any key.
- **Known limitations:** Enter-submit race makes leaderboard confirmation invisible; keyboard-only controls (no mobile touch); `loadLeaderboard`/`saveLeaderboard` error paths covered by tests but XSS risk in `showLeaderboard` unaddressed.

### Test Coverage
- **Test command:** `npm run test` / `npm run test:coverage`
- **Results:** 203 tests passing, 0 failing across 11 test files
- **New test files added this phase:** `leaderboard.test.js` (20 tests), `leaderboard-storage.test.js` (3 tests), `input.test.js` (6 tests), `sweep.test.js` (7 tests); plus additions to `tilt.test.js` (15 tests total, up from 11)

- Engine line coverage: **99%** (target: ≥ 80%)

- Still uncovered: `gameState.js` lines 162–168 (renderer-facing methods); `rotation.js` branches 27/29 (unreachable wall-kick edge cases); renderer modules (`scene.js`, `blockPool.js`, `composer.js`, `render.js`, `hud.js`) — all require WebGL context unavailable in Node
