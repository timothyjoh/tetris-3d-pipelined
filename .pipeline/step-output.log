Now let me run the test suites to get real numbers.
All tests pass — 206 Vitest, 10 Playwright. Now I'll update STATUS.md.
Now append the Phase 7 section:
Done. Here's what was written to `STATUS.md`:

**Header updated:** "Last updated after Phase 7" and the overview's "Current state" paragraph updated to mention the live Vercel URL and 10 E2E tests (up from 9).

**Phase 7 section added** covering:

- **What We Built** — the `stopImmediatePropagation` fix, strengthened `waitForFunction` guards, Test 7/8 comments, new Test 10 (click-to-start), Vercel deploy, and all doc updates
- **How to Run It** — dev, build/preview, and test commands, plus the live URL
- **Review Findings** — both MUST-FIX items (Vercel deploy incomplete, `waitForFunction` logic flaw) marked fixed; minor issues documented honestly
- **What's Next** — mobile controls, ghost piece, CI/CD, and the remaining guard upgrades for Tests 8–10
- **Test Coverage** — real numbers from the test run: 206 Vitest passing, 10 Playwright passing, 99% engine statement coverage; marked **PROJECT COMPLETE**
