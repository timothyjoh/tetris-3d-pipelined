Now let me run the tests to get real numbers:
All tests pass. Now I have everything I need to write the Phase 6 section. Let me append it to STATUS.md:
Now append the Phase 6 section:
STATUS.md updated. Here's what was written:

**Phase 6 section added to STATUS.md** covering:

- **What We Built** — all 9 concrete deliverables: start overlay, click/keypress to start, ESC pause, any-key resume, game-over ESC guard, two-overlay architecture, state-machine keydown handler, `VITE_TEST_HOOKS` build flag, and `reuseExistingServer: false` fix
- **How to Run It** — updated commands including the E2E rebuild behavior
- **Review Findings** — 3 MUST-FIX items (all fixed: `reuseExistingServer` footgun, Test 2 stale comment, missing Test 9 for R6) plus 3 deferred issues reported honestly
- **What's Next** — Vercel smoke test, `stopImmediatePropagation`, and other deferred items
- **Test Coverage** — real numbers from actual test runs: **206 Vitest tests passing**, **9 Playwright E2E tests passing** (5.6s), with per-test descriptions for all 9 E2E scenarios and the full engine coverage table

The Overview "Current state" was also updated to reflect the complete, feature-finished product.
