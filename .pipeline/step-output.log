Now let me run the tests to get real numbers:
I have all the data I need. Let me write the Phase 3 section to STATUS.md:
Now append the Phase 3 section:
Let me do a quick sanity check on the final file:
`STATUS.md` is updated. Here's a summary of what was written:

**Phase 3 section covers:**

- **What We Built** — tilt center-column fix (±7° restored), left-to-right sweep fix, leaderboard engine (`isTopTen`/`insertScore`/`rankEntries`/`loadLeaderboard`/`saveLeaderboard`), initials entry UI (3 chars, arcade style), game-over overlay redesign with ranked table and highlight, jsdom test setup for `input.test.js`, localStorage wrapper tests, Vercel deploy readiness, and docs updates.

- **Review Findings** — Honest about the critical Enter-key race condition (leaderboard confirmation is never visible to the user), plus the four minor issues (XSS risk in `showLeaderboard`, fragile listener accumulation in tests, `isTopTen` sorted-input assumption, duplicate test case). All noted as unfixed.

- **Test Coverage** — Real numbers from `npm run test:coverage`: **203 tests passing, 0 failing**, **99% line coverage** across all engine modules. The previously 0%-covered `leaderboard.js` localStorage wrappers are now at 100% via the new `leaderboard-storage.test.js`.

- **Overview and Current State** updated to reflect Phase 3 capabilities while being honest about the known UX bug.
