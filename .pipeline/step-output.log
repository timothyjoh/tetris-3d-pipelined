The STATUS.md already has Phase 8 content. Let me verify by checking the phase docs and running the actual tests to confirm the numbers are accurate.
The Vitest numbers confirm 211 passing. Let me run the E2E tests to verify the Playwright count too.
All tests pass. The STATUS.md is already accurate — it was written as part of the pipeline. Let me do a final verification that nothing needs updating:

**Actual test results:**
- Vitest: **211 passing, 0 failing** (13 test files) — matches STATUS.md
- Playwright: **14 passing, 0 failing** (6.7s) — matches STATUS.md (documented as 6.6s, negligible difference)
- Build: **clean, no warnings** — matches STATUS.md

The STATUS.md was already correctly updated after Phase 8. Here's a summary of what it documents for Phase 8:

**Phase 8: Mobile Touch Controls & Sound Toggle**

- On-screen `#touch-controls` (← ↑ ↓ → ⬛) shown on touch/≤768px viewports via CSS media query
- `src/input-touch.js` — event delegation, auto-repeat left/right (300ms/80ms), scroll prevention
- `gameState.muted` class field + `KeyM` binding + `#mute-btn` HUD icon (🔊/🔇)
- Audio gating in `main.js`; sound queue always drained to prevent buildup
- `waitForGameReady(page)` shared E2E helper replacing all inline guards
- E2E Tests 11–14: touch ←, touch rotate, touch hard drop, mute toggle
- Tests 8/9/10 `waitForFunction` guards upgraded (Phase 7 debt cleared)

**Known gaps carried forward:** R6 mute inconsistency (button blocked during game-over, M key is not); auto-repeat fires without `isActive()` check; no E2E test for touch soft-drop.

**Project is complete** — all 7 BRIEF.md features implemented, 211 Vitest + 14 Playwright tests passing, live at https://sdk-test-lemon.vercel.app.
