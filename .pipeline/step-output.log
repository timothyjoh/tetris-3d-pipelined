Now let me read the Phase 4 docs and run the tests in parallel.
Let me also get the coverage report for accurate numbers.
Now I have everything I need. Let me write the updated STATUS.md.
Now append the Phase 4 section to the end of the file.
Let me do a quick sanity check on the final file.
`STATUS.md` updated. Here's a summary of what was written:

**Header changes:**
- Bumped "Last updated after Phase 3" → Phase 4
- Updated "Current state" to reflect the 3D visual upgrade and the fixed Enter-key leaderboard flow

**Phase 4 section added** covering:

- **What We Built** — Enter-key race fix, PerspectiveCamera (Z=26, FOV 50°), BoxGeometry(0.85, 0.85, 0.85) cubes, DirectionalLight + roughness 0.4, Y-axis tilt with negated angle, grid/background compatibility verification, `initials-submit.test.js`, and CLAUDE.md docs
- **How to Run It** — same as prior phases; callout for what's new visually and the fixed leaderboard UX
- **Review Findings** — camera Z spec/plan discrepancy, false-positive test 4 deletion, race condition analysis, no `rotation.z` residual issue
- **What's Next** — Phase 5 Playwright e2e, Phase 6 start/pause/resume, remaining known debt
- **Test Coverage** — 206 passing / 0 failing across 12 files, 99% engine statement coverage (verified by actually running `npm run test:coverage`)
