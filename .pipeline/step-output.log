Now let me run the tests to get actual results.
All tests pass. Now I'll append the Phase 5 section to STATUS.md.
Now append the Phase 5 section at the end of the file.
STATUS.md has been updated. Here's a summary of what was written for Phase 5:

**Phase 5: Playwright E2E Testing & Gameplay Video Recording**

- **What was built:** Playwright installed with Chromium, `playwright.config.ts` (headless, video on, retries 1, HTML reporter, webServer), `window.__gameState` test hook in `main.js`, 5 E2E tests in `tests/gameplay.spec.ts`, `.gitignore`, and `test:e2e`/`test:e2e:ui` npm scripts. Key discovery: `--use-gl=angle` is required for WebGL to work in headless Chromium (SwiftShader fails otherwise).

- **Actual test results (just run):**
  - Vitest: **206 tests passing, 0 failing** (12 files, unchanged from Phase 4)
  - Playwright: **5 tests passing, 0 failing** (4.3s)
  - Build: clean, no warnings

- **Honest review findings documented:** 4 deferred code-quality issues noted (redundant `BASE` constant, stale RAF comment, weak Test 2 assertion, imprecise Test 3 `not.toHaveText` assertion) — all carried forward to Phase 6 pre-work.

- **Overview and "Last updated" header** updated to reflect Phase 5 as the current state.
