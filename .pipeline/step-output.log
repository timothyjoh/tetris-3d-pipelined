Now let me run the tests to get actual results:
All tests are in. Now I have everything I need to write the updated STATUS.md:
Now append the Phase 2 section:
`STATUS.md` has been updated. Here's a summary of what was written:

**Phase 2 section added** covers:

- **What We Built** — Board tilt (spring/damper, `boardGroup` Z-rotation), ghost piece (`computeGhostRow` + dim pool render), lock flash (100ms white override on locked cells), line-clear sweep animation (150ms, gravity paused during sweep), all 8 synthesized sound effects via Web Audio API, sound event queue pattern, keyboard restart (Enter/R), and tech-debt cleanup (redundant `randomPieceType()` removed, `onRestart` wired, build warning fixed).

- **Review Findings** — Honest accounting: the build warning and missing `levelUp` test were fixed; the tilt column deviation (max ~2.33° instead of ±7°) and non-horizontal sweep animation are explicitly called out as deferred known debt for Phase 3.

- **Test Coverage** — Real numbers from `npm run test:coverage`: **163 tests passing, 0 failing**, **98.89% statement coverage** across all 7 engine modules (up from 115 tests / 98.54% after Phase 1).
